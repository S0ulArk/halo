// Which Health Connect records the import keeps (the person's choice, stored on the phone). Health Connect holds
// whatever every app wrote: the Google Health (Fitbit) app's band data, but also the phone's own step counting (from
// Google Health itself or another health app), which reads differently and doubled steps. The default keeps the band.
//
// How a record is classified:
//   • Its app is `metadata.dataOrigin`: a Fitbit record comes from one of FITBIT_PACKAGES (the Google Health app is the
//     renamed Fitbit app and kept its package).
//   • Its device is `metadata.device.type` (Health Connect's Device.TYPE_*). A Fitbit-app record measured by the phone
//     (TYPE_PHONE) is the phone, not the band. A record without device information, or of another type (watch, band,
//     ring, scale, chest strap), counts as Fitbit.
//   • Entries typed in (recordingMethod MANUAL_ENTRY), and the log-like types (weight, body fat, water, food, glucose,
//     temperature, cycle) are never dropped for their device: logging a weigh-in or a glass of water on the phone is
//     still the Fitbit app's record.
// Pulse's own logs (the Journal) never come from Health Connect and are unaffected.
