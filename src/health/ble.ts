// Live heart rate over Bluetooth: one controller for the app around react-native-ble-plx's BleManager. It owns the
// Android permissions (Nearby devices), the radio state, the scan for bands advertising the standard Heart Rate
// Service (0x180D), the connection and the 0x2A37 subscription, and emits each notification as a sample. The React
// side (src/state/liveBle.tsx) turns samples into what the screens draw; the parsing is src/health/bleHr.ts.
//
// The band (a Fitbit Air with Google Health › Fitbit Air › Connections › Share heart rate on) serves one connection
// at a time and sharing costs its battery, so Pulse only holds it while it is on screen: 30 s after Pulse leaves the
// foreground the link is let go, and it is picked up again on return. The chosen band is remembered
// ("pulse.ble.device"); with auto-connect on (off by default, for the band's battery) Pulse reconnects to it whenever it
// comes to the foreground. A dropped link retries with exponential backoff, then gives up and says why.
//
// Nothing here throws to the UI: no Bluetooth (the emulator), a refused permission or a radio that is off become a
// status. Samples are display-only and never written to the Store (Health Connect stays the scoring source).
