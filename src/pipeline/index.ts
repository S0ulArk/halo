// The two-stage recompute (KTD6), as the web app runs it. Stage 1 (stage1.ts) reads the heavy per-sample
// buckets for the days whose inputs changed and caches per-day results; stage 2 (stage2.ts, scorers in scores.ts)
// folds every day, oldest first, over daily rows and those cached results. Every value for day D depends only on
// D and earlier days, except where a feature is defined over the evening that follows (Energy Bank stops at
// tonight's bedtime, Stress leaves out tonight's sleep), so adding a later night never changes an earlier day's
// scores.
//
// Determinism: the same Store gives byte-identical score rows, and writes only touch rows whose JSON differs,
// so an unchanged recompute writes nothing.
