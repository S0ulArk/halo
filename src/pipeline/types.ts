/**
 * Bump on any scoring change; a mismatch at startup reruns both stages for every day.
 * 1: U5 scorers. 2: SRI consistency in sleep performance (U7), U10 pipeline. 3: one age helper
 * (healthspan and fitness age agree with whole years on birthdays). 4: local days open at the right instant
 * where DST starts at midnight (Santiago, Havana, Azores...), so the 23-hour day is the right one. 5: Pulse Age's
 * stored key is `pulseAge` (was a brand name), so stored healthspan rows rescore. 6: Google's inputs first (its daily
 * zones, resting HR, time in zones, skin-temperature baseline and personal ranges), four named zones. 7: five
 * display zones on heart-rate reserve (Strain's and WHOOP's 50/60/70/80/90%) in place of Google's four. 8: max HR
 * no longer from Google's PEAK zone (a flat 220), so zones and Strain use the person's own or Tanaka's.
 * 10 (mobile only; the web is at 9): resting HR carried up to 30 days, else estimated from the day's own still HR,
 * before the 60 bpm default (stage 1); Pulse Age's zone and strength terms only on days with 12 h of HR; Training
 * load leaves a day without an Effort out instead of counting 0; Pulse Age reports its term count, and its moderate-
 * activity input counts from 40 % of heart-rate reserve (stage 1's `moderateSeconds`), not from Zone 1's 50 %.
 * 11: Pulse Age rebuilt on WHOOP's Healthspan method (bout-counted zone minutes, `boutZoneSeconds`), and Fitness Age.
 * 12: its refinements (Paluch's step curves by age, a 60–80 % minute counted twice, 4.77 years per ln HR).
 * 13: Fitness Age's activity index reads real zone minutes, not Pulse Age's doubled ones; the sleep planner's wake times
 * are clock minutes on DST days (lib/time localMinutes).
 * 14: Pulse Age's sleep consistency pools its window's pairs of nights, each pair once, instead of averaging the daily
 * 7-day SRIs (which counted early nights several times).
 * 15 (WHOOP/Garmin alignment, docs/research/whoop-garmin.md, batch 1): zones on WHOOP's 2024 edges (Zone 1 from 40 % of
 * the reserve); Strain on continuous Banister TRIMP through 5.05 · ln(1 + 0.09 · TRIMP), with a waking floor for Day
 * Strain, 10-minute credit for quiet sparse readings and muscular load for strength-type sessions; max HR learned from
 * workout heart rate when the profile has none.
 * 16 (batch 2): Sleep Performance on WHOOP's 2025 four parts (hours against the night's full need, WHOOP-style 4-day
 * consistency, efficiency, Sleep Stress from sleeping heart rate); restorative sleep shown, not scored. Sleep need adds
 * WHOOP's patented strain sigmoid and a debt term capped at an hour (debt over 28 nights), within 6.5–11 h, and
 * bedtimes leave the typical minutes to fall asleep.
 * 17 (batch 3): Recovery on WHOOP's 2026 inputs: HRV z on ln(RMSSD) against a 21-night-half-life ln baseline, weights
 * 0.58 / 0.22 / 0.20, respiratory rate only lowering the score, skin temperature out (still in Health Monitor).
 * 18 (batch 4): Garmin's training load (linear TRIMP, a 10-day decaying acute load, a 28-day chronic load, ratio bands
 * 0.8 / 1.5 / 2.0; Strain Target's cap at 1.5); Energy Bank as a 24-hour Body Battery-style reserve (5–100, sleep charges
 * it, each day carries on from the last, a per-minute TRIMP drain); Halo Age counts zone minutes once, yoga, Pilates and
 * boot camp as strength, and publishes Pace of Aging on Mondays with 21 of 31 days scored for Recovery.
 * 19 (batch 5, new columns): HRV Status (`hrv_status`) and Garmin-style training (`training`: Aerobic Training Effect
 * from each workout's peak EPOC, which stage 1 now stores, Recovery Time, Training Readiness 1–100, Training Status);
 * VO2 max categories on Garmin's 40 / 60 / 80 / 95 percentiles; workouts auto-detected from 10 minutes (WHOOP, 2026).
