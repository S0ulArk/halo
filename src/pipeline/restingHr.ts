// The resting HR a day's zones, Strain and minute load sit on, when the day has neither Fitbit's daily value nor a
// sleep-session estimate (mobile addition; the web falls straight back to 60 bpm). Health Connect often carries heart
// rate without resting HR or sleep, and 60 bpm put an unfit person's zones far too low: at a true resting HR of 78 and
// max 189, Zone 1 started at 124.5 bpm instead of 133.5, so an hour's brisk walk at 128 bpm counted as 60 zone minutes and
// Strain 9.7 instead of nothing.
//
// The chain: the day's daily record → its session estimate → the newest of either in the 30 days before (resting HR
// moves slowly) → an estimate from the day's own HR → 60 bpm.
